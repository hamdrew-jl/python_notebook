# Mail Merge Project



## Files system
Use Python to open files, read files, write to the files and close them down without touching mouse.

### 01 Read 

When we open a file, it will take up some resources of your computer, 
sometimes it might decide to close file to free up those resources, so need to tell it to close files.

* create a file (.txt)
```python
file = open("name_of_the_file.txt")
contents = file.read()
print contents
file.close()
```

* Instead. Use 'with' keyword
```python
with open("name_of_the_file.txt") as file:
  contents = file.read()
  print contents
```

### 02 Write
* remember to call mode because by default, it's set to read-only ("r")
  
```python
with open("name_of_the_file.txt", mode="w") as file:
  contents = file.write("New text: ")
  print(contents)
```
Note: This way will delete everything in name_of_the_file.txt
      If you want to add something after it, change the mode from 'w' to 'a' 
      'a' stands for append
      
```python
with open("name_of_the_file.txt", mode="a") as file:
  contents = file.write("\nNew text: ")
```
Note: If you try to open a file in write mode and that file doesn't exist,
      it's going to create it from scratch.
      A new file will show in the folder.
      only work in 'w' mode.
      
```python
with open("new_file.txt", mode="w") as file:
  contents = file.write("New text: ")
```

### 03 Understand Relative and Absolute File Paths
* Files and folders, file could place within folder
* File Path
  1. Absolute File Path
  ```python
    /  # Root
    /work
    /work/report.doc
    /work/project/talk.ppt
  ```

  2. Relative File Path
  Once we've established a working directory, we can use 'relative file path' to get to a file.
 ```python
    ./talk.ppt  # if we are in project folder
    ./project/talk.ppt  # if we are in work folder
    ../report.doc  # if we are in project folder
```
Note: Two dot (..)represents going one step up in the hierarchy to the parent folder

### 04 Practice Mail Merge Project 
* List of names
* default letter, change the guest name
* Put each letter into 'Output' folder separately

Final code

```python
with open("./Input/Names/invited_names.txt") as names:
    names = names.readlines()

with open("./Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt") as letter_file:
    letter_content = letter_file.read()
    for i in names:
        new_name = i.strip()
        new_letter = letter_content.replace("[name]", new_name)
        print(new_letter)
        with open(f"./Output/ReadyToSend/letter_for_{new_name}.txt", "w")  as completed_letter:
            completed_letter.write(new_letter)
```
